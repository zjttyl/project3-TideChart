KKNOWN ISSUES

- Traffic Load: NOAA API is overloaded when graph is created simultaneously with 3-4+ devices. Slows down graph creation significantly.

- Invalid dates: Users are able to select non-viable dates from the drop down menu. i.e. dates like 1563.

- No offline fallback: Application does not display cached data during API downtime.
-- Reason: limited time and complexity of implementing offline storage.

- Date picker validation styling: Invalid date range (end date before start) shows alert but lacks visual feedback. 

- Tide date range: Data too far in the future or in the past (roughly 2101 and beyond, and 1700 and before), will not display. 
-- Reason: This is a limitation of the NOAA API, as it does not predict or store anything beyond that.

- Mobile date picking bug: On the mobile version, selecting a date will give you the date you picked but 2 days after.

- Graph rescaling issue: Shrinking the website and then resizing it back to full size will keep the graph as the size it was when it was smaller.
